# FutureGradeCalculator
Be able to determine GPA from past and future classes in college using different GPA scales and point systems.

Project Name: Future Grade Calculator
Languages: HTML/PHP/Javascript

Notes About This project:
  -For this project's inital makeup I will be using Agile development methods in two week sprints.
  -This project is purely for fun and personally I can see use in this as in my semesters in college we were given a grade calculator that    would only go as far as the next semester in terms of future calculations. In this case I always wanted to know 3-4 semester ahead if I    did well what my GPA should be.
